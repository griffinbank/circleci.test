;; Once fixtures should be run exactly once regardless of which entry-point
;; into circleci.test is used
;;
;; The two entry-points are test-ns and test-var
;; For test-ns the once fixtures should be run before any tests in the ns are
;; run.
;; For test-var the once fixtures should be run before the test is run.
;;
;; This means test-var must attempt to run once fixtures each time it is
;; invoked.
;;
;; To avoid constantly recalculating once fixtures we map the ns to a
;; fixture-generating function.
;; When running once fixtures we look up the fixture generating fn and invoke
;; it to produce the once-fixtures-fn.
;; Before invoking the generated once-fixtures-fn we bind a new mapping from
;; the ns the test var belongs to to a fixture generating fn that produces a
;; dummy once-fixture.
